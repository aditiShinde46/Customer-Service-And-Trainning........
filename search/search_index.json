Conduct a time audit.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Start by assessing where you actually spend your time. Create a visual map of the approximate hours you spend on work, school, housework and chores, commuting, social media, and leisure activities. Then, you can drill in on school or work, dividing your previous week into days, then hours. How much time did it take to finish that paper? Did a work project take longer because you were scrolling on your phone?</p> </li> <li> <p>Set goals based on this outcome. Planning ahead and setting time limits on your tasks and priorities can free up time for what\u2019s most important to you, like spending more time with friends and family.</p> </li> <li> <p>Start by dedicating a half hour every Sunday to intentionally planning your week ahead and setting daily goals.</p> </li> </ul> <p>2. Use the Eisenhower Matrix to set your priorities.</p> <ul> <li>The Eisenhower Matrix is a popular tool that helps you distinguish between tasks that are important, not important, urgent, and not urgent. The quadrant has four boxes in which you can split your tasks to prioritize what you should focus on first. They also correspond with the 4 D\u2019s of execution: do, defer, delegate, and delete.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Quadrant 1: Important and urgent. Do these tasks first. These are the priorities that are most relevant to your goals.</p> <p>\u00b7 Quadrant 2: Important but not urgent. Defer these for later in your schedule.</p> <p>\u00b7 Quadrant 3: Urgent but not important. Delegate these to others, if possible, especially if they do not contribute to your long-term goals.</p> <p>\u00b7 Quadrant 4: Not important and not urgent. Delete these tasks, or do them when you have free time because they are distractions from your priorities.</p> <p>For an even simpler approach, create a task list and mark each item as urgent or important. Often, we prioritize urgent tasks instead of important ones\u2014such as tasks that may be creative, important, and fulfilling but do not have a deadline\u2014so identifying and labeling them can be a helpful step toward accomplishing your personal and professional goals.</p> <p>3. Employ methods to \u201cchunk\u201d your time.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Once you have a better idea of what your priorities are, setting limits can be an excellent time management tool. There are several options for chunking your time into digestible pieces.</p> </li> <li> <p>Try the Pomodoro method. This technique was developed in the late 1980s by Francesco Cirillo, a university student who was overwhelmed by studying and assignments. The Pomodoro method requires using a timer to break down your work into 25-minute intervals, separated by 5 minutes of break time. After four pomodoros, you may take a longer 15-30 minute break. Pomodoro (\u201ctomato\u201d in Italian) promotes concentration and relieves mental fatigue, which is especially useful for open-ended work like conducting research, studying for an exam, or finishing a consulting project.</p> </li> </ul> <p>4. Focus on one thing at a time.</p> <ul> <li> <p>For most of us, multitasking is generally less efficient than focusing on one task at a time. In fact, one study found that only 2.5 percent of people are able to multitask effectively . Doing too many things at once can impact your cognitive ability, making you feel unproductive or dissatisfied with your progress. Arranging your time so that you complete one task before starting another can boost your confidence.</p> </li> <li> <p>Further, it may be helpful to compartmentalize tasks. If you are a writer, for example, you might dedicate Monday to research, Tuesday through Thursday to writing, and Friday to editing. </p> </li> </ul> <p>5. Give yourself a reward.</p> <p>Rewards can be a great source of motivation for adopting good time management habits. For each important task you accomplish, you can give yourself a little treat. It doesn't need to be extravagant or expensive. Here are some simple ways to motivate yourself:</p> <p>\u00b7 Taking a break to enjoy your favorite snack</p> <p>\u00b7 Going for a short walk outside</p> <p>\u00b7 Call a friend or family member</p> <p>\u00b7 Meditate for five minutes</p> <p>\u00b7 Listen to a podcast episode or a chapter of an audiobook</p> <ul> <li>For bigger rewards, you can indulge in activities like reading a book in the bath, planning a night out with friends, or booking a getaway. Exciting rewards can help you push through an especially tough project or work period.</li> </ul> <p>6. Use apps to block out distractions.</p> <ul> <li>Sometimes, rewards and good intentions are not enough to keep us focused. An app or browser extension can help you minimize distractions by blocking you from using social media or touching your phone. Here are some apps and extensions you can try:</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Forest is an app that helps you stay focused and off your phone. The company partners with an organization called Trees for the Future to plant trees when you spend virtual coins earned in Forest.</p> <p>\u00b7 StayFocused is a browser extension that prevents you from using time-wasting websites like Reddit, Twitter, Wikipedia, Instagram, and more. It\u2019s highly configurable, so you can customize it to your specific distractions.</p> <p>\u00b7 Freedom is a tool that can block both websites and apps on all of your devices, simultaneously. Take advantage of their free trial to know if it\u2019s right for you.</p>"},{"location":"10/#what-are-time-management-techniques","title":"What are time management techniques?","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Time management itself revolves around choices \u2014 you decide what you need to do, when you need to finish, and what tasks you need to tackle in order to reach your goals.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you choose to make high-value, goal-oriented tasks a priority, finish them before the deadline, but also leave time for leading a healthy life, you'll be able to say that you've managed your time successfully.

Remember that conflict is natural and happens in every ongoing relationship. Since conflict is unavoidable we must learn to manage it. Conflict is a sign of a need for change and an opportunity for growth, new understanding, and improved communication. Conflict can not be resolved unless it is addressed with the appropriate individual(s).</p> <p>Be a calming agent. Regardless of whether you are being a sounding board for a friend or you are dealing with your own conflict, your response to the conflict can escalate or decrease the intensity of the problem. To be calming, provide an objective or neutral point of view. Help plan how you are going to work with the other party to achieve resolution.</p> <p>Listen actively. Work through how you feel, what the specific problem is and what impact it is having on you. Use I -based statements to help do this (see formula below).</p> <ul> <li> <p>I feel (strongest feeling)</p> </li> <li> <p>When you (objective description of the behavior)</p> </li> <li> <p>Because (specific impact or consequences)</p> </li> <li> <p>I would like (what you want the person to do in the future to prevent the problem)</p> </li> </ul> <p>Analyze the conflict. This will help clarify the specific problem. Some questions that you may ask are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>What triggered the conflict?</p> </li> <li> <p>Who are you angry with?</p> </li> <li> <p>What are you not getting that you want?</p> </li> <li> <p>What are you afraid of losing?</p> </li> <li> <p>Is your conflict/anger accurate or over exaggerated?</p> </li> <li> <p>How can your conflict be resolved?</p> </li> </ul> <p>Model neutral language. When people are in conflict they use inflammatory language such as profanity, name calling, and exaggerations that escalate the conflict. Restate inflammatory language in a more objective way to help make the information less emotionally laden and more useful for future discussions.</p> <p>Separate the person from the problem.* View the problem as a specific behavior or set of circumstances rather than attributing negative feelings to the whole person. This approach makes the problem more manageable and hopeful than deciding you \u201ccan\u2019t stand\u201d this person any longer. <p>Work together. This requires that each person stop placing blame and take ownership of the problem. Make a commitment to work together and listen to each other to solve the conflict.</p> <p>Agree to disagree. Each person has a unique point of view and rarely agrees on every detail. Being right is not what is important. When managing conflict, seeking the \u201ctruth\u201d can trap you rather than set you free. For example, consider the differing testimony of witnesses that all see the same car accident. Truth is relative to the person\u2019s point of view.</p> <p>Focus on the future. In conflict we tend to remember every single thing that ever bothered us about that person. People in conflict need to vent about the past but they often dwell on the past. Often the best way to take ownership of the problem is to recognize that regardless of the past, you need to create a plan to address the present conflict and those that may arise in the future.</p> <p>\u201cMove past positions.\u201d A position is the desired outcome of a conflict. Often the position is \u201cI need a new roommate\u201d or \u201cThis person is impossible to live with.\u201d Positions are not negotiable and result in impasse. To resolve conflict, each person has to \u201cmove past positions.\u201d</p> <p>Share your interests. To solve interpersonal conflict, all parties must talk about their interests or the WHYs behind their positions. They must share their true interests and work together to find a solution that satisfies those interests. Common interests for students are to sleep, study, entertain and relax in a comfortable atmosphere. Often their interests are more intangible such as respect, belonging, friendship, and fun. When individuals have differing lifestyles, values, and schedules the need to discuss their differences is critical in managing conflict. You must develop a balanced plan of give and take that satisfies everyone\u2019s interests.</p> <p>Be creative. Finding a resolution to the problem that satisfies everyone requires creativity and hard work. Be careful not to give in simply to avoid conflict or maintain harmony. Agreements reached too early usually do not last. Generate silly options to begin thinking \u201coutside of the box\u201d of original positions.</p> <p>Be specific. When problem solving be very specific. For example if you are using a roommate agreement to facilitate the discussion make sure that everyone fully understands each point that is written down. Clarify ambiguous terms that each person may interpret differently.</p> <p>Maintain confidentiality. Encourage others who are in conflict to deal directly with the person they are in conflict with. Avoiding the conflict and venting to others tends to escalate the conflict and fuels the rumor mill. If rumors are already part of the conflict, encourage them to work out a plan to put an end to the gossip. Do your part to quell rumors.</p>"},{"location":"12/#5-conflict-resolution-strategies","title":"5 conflict resolution strategies:","text":"<p>Different people use different methods to resolve conflict, depending on their personalities and preferences. The five most common strategies, known as the (Kenneth) Thomas-(Ralph) Kilmann model,  used to resolve conflicts in the workplace include</p> <p>1. Avoiding</p> <p>This method involves simply ignoring that there may be a conflict. People tend to avoid conflict when they don\u2019t want to engage in it. Avoiding allows them to ignore that there is a problem.</p> <p>There are situations when avoiding conflict can be an appropriate response, such as when there is no clear solution or a frustrated party needs time to calm down before confrontation. However, avoidance can require more effort than merely facing the problem and can cause friction between the disagreeing parties. When confict is avoided, nothing is resolved.</p> <p>2. Competing     Competing is an uncooperative, overly assertive method used by people who insist on winning the dispute at all costs. It\u2019s known as a win-lose strategy. This method is not often identified as bringing satisfactory resolutions, as it doesn\u2019t allow for collaborative problem-solving.</p> <p>3. Accommodating</p> <p>This strategy, also known as smoothing, involves one party acquiescing, giving the opposing party exactly what it needs to resolve the problem. This method allows you to resolve a problem in the short-term while working toward a long-term solution.</p> <p>In some cases, accommodating can be an appropriate resolution to a conflict. For example, if your opinion on the matter is not very strong, it is often easier to comply. </p> <p>4. Collaborating</p> <p>Like the compromising method, collaboration involves working with the other party to find a mutually agreeable solution to a problem. It\u2019s known as a win-win strategy. For example, a salesperson and client may work together to negotiate contract terms until both parties find it agreeable.</p> <p>5. Compromising</p> <p>This strategy, also known as reconciling, seeks a mutual agreement to settle a dispute. It\u2019s known as a lose-lose strategy since both parties willingly forfeit some of their needs in the interest of reaching an agreement. This can be a quick way to resolve a conflict without it becoming a bigger issue. Compromise can also be used as a temporary method to avoid conflict until the parties involved can implement a more permanent solution.</p> <p>It is appropriate to compromise when it would not be possible to make both sides completely happy while still moving forward.</p> <p>13 de-escalation techniques to use in customer service</p> <p>As a customer support agent, using de-escalation techniques can help you maintain respectful troubleshooting conversations with clients and enhance the productiveness of your work. It's important that customers have a positive experience, and while supporting clients with high-level concerns and emotional responses can be challenging work, de-escalation techniques may help streamline your processes and help you address complaints effectively. Here are 13 de-escalation techniques to employ that may help keep clients calm and satisfied as you try to support them:</p> <p>1. Stay confident</p> <p>As you move through your conversation with a dissatisfied customer, you should try to stay confident in your abilities to resolve their problems. When you're empowered and portray strength as a customer support agent, it's more likely that a customer will respect your boundaries and act accordingly.</p> <p>2. Script your response</p> <p>If you know that you're likely to come across a challenging customer interaction in your role at some point, you may consider preparing for such instances by scripting your response. By doing so, you can avoid improvising your strategy for de-escalation and conflict resolution. To script your response, you can practice responding to different customer concerns that you anticipate coming across in your work.</p> <p>You might even consider practicing these conversations with a trusted friend or colleague to see how your script works in a real-life dialogue. Not only will rehearsing your response help you remain confident in your abilities to assist such customers, but having a script handy can help you maintain a steady tone even when customers express their frustration.</p> <p>3. Listen actively</p> <p>In many cases, customers contact support agents to express their frustrations, vent about concerns and find solutions to challenging situations\u2014meaning that they're looking for somebody to listen to and help them. In order to help your customers feel heard during your conversations, try to practice active listening strategies as they recount their experiences. Without interrupting customers as they speak, acknowledge their concerns, ask questions to clarify details about their experiences and use validating language.</p> <p>If you're peaking with a customer in person, using appropriate non-verbal cues can also help show that you're listening to their concerns carefully. You should try to maintain eye contact, keep your arms uncrossed and nod as they speak. Listening to customers patiently can help them calm down and provide you with key details about their experiences that may influence how you can solve their problems.</p> <p>4. Mirror their complaint</p> <p>While you actively listen to a customer's complaints, validate their concerns and try to identify solutions that satisfy them, you want to make sure you understand their concerns fully. In order to do this, you should mirror a customer's complaint by repeating how they describe their experiences and what frustrations they've shared with you. Not only will this help you with navigating problem-solving processes, but it will help customers feel heard and understood as you attempt to support them. This is a key element to de-escalating challenging customer support conversations.</p> <p>5. Stay calm </p> <p>When customers come to you for support, they may express emotions of frustration, irritability or anger. This can be challenging to manage, but it's important to remember that customers aren't upset with you\u2014rather, they're dissatisfied with a particular product or service your company provides.</p> <p>Therefore, when managing conversations with emotional customers, you should try your best to avoid taking their complaints personally and remain calm overall. Leaving your emotions out of the conversation, speaking objectively and maintaining a placid tone can help you act as a calming force while handling dissatisfied customers. This will give you the ability to get past their emotions and uncover the root problem causing their concerns.</p> <p>6. Identify the root cause</p> <p>When customers call and express their frustration with a product or service, it's not always immediately clear what originally made the customer experience dissatisfaction. Customers may obscure the root cause behind their dissatisfaction through complaining about other factors. For example, a customer may have particularly high expectations for a product due to an advertisement they saw. If the product doesn't live up to those promises, the customer may decide to call for support and demand a replacement product or refund.</p> <p>While they're upset about the product's inability to fulfill the promises made in the advertisement, they may instead complain about the company's inability to provide a replacement or refund. As a customer support agent, it's your responsibility to investigate customer complaints deeply and identify the root cause so that you can help resolve such concerns in the best way possible. You can do this by asking specific and targeted questions about the customer's experiences with the product.</p> <p>7. Break the problem down</p> <p>If a customer comes to you with a particularly complex or multifaceted problem, you can try to de-escalate their frustrations by breaking the problem down into more manageable portions. Since smaller problems are easier to tackle, you can address these portions one-by-one and make tangible progress in resolving the customer's concerns. If a customer sees that you're working diligently in coming up with practical solutions to the larger issue they presented, they may take a step back and try to approach the support conversation with respect from that point out.</p> <p>Even if a customer doesn't shift their tone as you work through their issues, this strategy can help you be more efficient in your support processes overall. With this, you can manage challenging problems that may have otherwise been time-consuming within a shorter time span. Therefore, breaking the problem down can help you effectively solve a customer's problems expeditiously and may encourage customers to treat you with civility.</p> <p>8. Offer sympathy</p> <p>While customers typically approach customer support agents in order to resolve their problems, they may also do so as they seek validation of their frustrations. Some customers want support agents to confirm that their frustrations are justifiable\u2014and while this isn't always the case, it's your duty to maintain a validating facade and help customers feel heard. With this, you should try to sympathize with customer concerns and somehow offer validation.</p> <p>You might consider using affirming statements like \"I totally understand how this experience has been frustrating for you. Let's try to work together to find a solution to your concerns,\" or \"That sounds like a dissatisfying experience. I'm going to do my best to help you resolve this issue.\" These efforts may help customers acknowledge your reasonability as you attempt to support them. When customers feel understood by support agents, they're more likely to treat said agents with consideration.</p> <p>9. Be realistic</p> <p>As a customer support agent, it's incredibly important that you remain realistic in your abilities to resolve a customer's problems or provide them with solutions they request. You should avoid making promises that you may not be able to keep. Rather, try to present solutions you know are feasible\u2014even if these solutions aren't exactly what a customer wants, it's better for you to be honest in the long term. In situations like this, make sure that you tell customers you're trying to identify a solution, but some solutions may lie outside of your control.</p> <p>If customers understand that you're doing all that you can to address a problem and find a solution, they will usually appreciate your efforts, even if they don't get exactly what they want in the end. While it's your responsibility to help maintain customer satisfaction, there are only so many tactics you have at your disposal to do so\u2014keep this in mind as you navigate these conversations.</p> <p>10.  Avoid putting customers on hold</p> <p>When customers call support centers, companies often route them through lengthy automatic voice messages. They may experience wait times and sometimes, they're even directed to the wrong department. This causes them to be put on hold repeatedly as they wait for agents to become available or for agents to transfer them from department to department. This can be especially frustrating for customers who feel that they're already being inconvenienced through their dissatisfaction with a product or service. Therefore, you should try to avoid putting customers on hold to avoid increased challenges, especially if they're already expressing negative emotions about their experience.</p> <p>11.  Narrate your problem-solving processes</p> <p>Putting customers on hold may exacerbate their negative feelings and make it more challenging for you to address their concerns. Instead, talk to them as you research solutions to their issues\u2014tell them the exact steps you're taking to find a resolution. If you need to put a customer on hold at any point to speak to a supervisor or colleague about the solution, ask them politely whether they would mind holding briefly. This narration can help customers recognize your careful efforts as you attempt to streamline the support process.</p> <p>12.  Apologize</p> <p>Apologies are one of the most underrated de-escalation techniques for handling frustrated and emotional customers. While you may want to avoid admitting fault when a customer complains, you should try to express your apologies that the customer is experiencing an issue in the first place.

One key aspect of this is ensuring that your brand's personality evolves alongside changing consumer preferences. As consumer tastes and preferences shift, brands must be willing to adjust their personality traits and positioning strategies to maintain a strong connection with their target audience. Here are some insights, tips, and case studies to help you navigate this process effectively.</li> </ul> <p>1. Conduct regular market research: To truly understand the changing preferences of your target audience, it is essential to conduct regular market research. This will help you identify emerging trends, consumer needs, and potential gaps in the market that your brand can fill. By staying informed about the evolving preferences of your target audience, you can make informed decisions about how to adapt your brand personality.</p> <p>2. Stay true to your brand essence: While it is important to evolve, it is equally crucial to stay true to your brand's essence. Your brand personality should reflect your core values and mission. For example, if your brand is known for being environmentally conscious, it would not be wise to suddenly adopt a personality that contradicts this value. Instead, find ways to incorporate new trends and preferences while still remaining authentic to your brand's identity.</p> <p>3. Embrace flexibility: Consumer preferences can change rapidly, and brands need to be agile enough to respond quickly. This requires a flexible approach to brand personality. One way to achieve this is by creating a set of core personality traits that remain consistent, while allowing for variations and adaptations to suit different consumer segments or trends. For instance, a brand known for its luxury appeal may need to adjust its personality to cater to a more budget-conscious audience during economic downturns.</p> <p>4. Case study: Coca-Cola's evolving brand personality: Coca-Cola is a prime example of a brand that has successfully adapted its personality to changing consumer preferences over the years. While the brand's core values of happiness and togetherness have remained consistent, Coca-Cola has embraced various trends and societal changes to stay relevant. From their \"Share a Coke\" campaign, which personalized their bottles with popular names, to their commitment to sustainability, Coca-Cola has shown its ability to evolve while maintaining a strong brand personality.</p> <p>5. Tips for adapting your brand personality: When adapting your brand personality, consider the following tips:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Listen to your customers: Engage with your audience through social media, surveys, and other feedback channels to gain insights into their changing preferences.</p> </li> <li> <p>Monitor industry trends: Keep a close eye on industry trends and your competitors to identify opportunities for differentiation and adaptation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Test and iterate: Don't be afraid to experiment with new personality traits or positioning strategies. Monitor the impact of these changes and make adjustments as needed.</p> </li> <li> <p>In conclusion, evolving your brand personality to adapt to changing consumer preferences is essential for long-term success. By conducting regular market research, staying true to your brand essence, embracing flexibility, and learning from successful case studies like Coca-Cola, you can ensure that your brand remains relevant and resonates with your target audience in an ever-evolving marketplace.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"13/#2-the-importance-of-adapting-to-changing-consumer-preferences","title":"2.

Market research plays a vital role in helping businesses understand and adapt to these evolving consumer needs. Here are some key insights, tips, and case studies on how market research can aid businesses in adapting to changing consumer needs and preferences.</p> </li> <li> <p>Identifying emerging trends:</p> </li> <li> <p>One of the primary benefits of market research is its ability to identify emerging trends.

Sometimes that disconnect is caused by a customer's unreasonable expectations or incorrect assumptions. Other times, it's caused by something your company is doing wrong.</p> </li> <li> <p>A customer complaint might be the result of your marketing copy leading them to believe something incorrect about your product/service \u2014 or of your user experience setting customers up for failure. Or it could reflect a problem that's happening outside of your direct control (e.g., third-party shipping issues).</p> </li> <li> <p>The only way to find out is to give credence to customer complaints to determine if they contain genuinely useful feedback.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"14/#a-5-step-process-for-handling-customer-complaints","title":"A 5-step process for handling customer complaints","text":"<ul> <li>To uncover the reason you received a complaint from a customer and solve the problem in order to retain that customer, use this five-step process for handling customer complaints.</li> </ul> <p>Step 1: Dig deeper by asking the right questions</p> <p>Complaints \u2014 even angry ones \u2014 can contain insights, and it\u2019s your job to seek out the point of friction. Socratic questioning can help you get to the source of the issue.</p> <p>Ask your customer questions like:</p> <p>\u00b7 What do you mean by...? \u00b7 Could you provide an example? \u00b7 Could you expand on that point further?</p> <p>And ask yourself questions like:</p> <p>\u00b7 What other information do I need? \u00b7 What am I assuming here? \u00b7 Why is this complaint important?</p> <ul> <li> <p>Often, complaints are the result of problems that need to be solved. Asking the right questions helps you get to the root of the complaint, figure out if there's a way to resolve the issue, and determine if the complaint contains genuinely useful feedback.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you determine that you aren't the right person to help with the customer's complaint and need to transfer them to someone who can, make sure to explain why. This can be as simple as saying, \"I\u2019m going to set you up with our specialist who will get that squared away for you right away.\"</p> </li> </ul> <p>Step 2: Identify the type of customer you're dealing with</p> <ul> <li>A study from the University of Florida found that when dealing with customer complaints, you may run into one of the following types of customers, each \"motivated by different beliefs, attitudes, and needs\":</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Customers who aren't shy about letting you know they're upset. When responding, avoid mirroring their confrontational behavior; instead, react with firm politeness.</p> <p>\u00b7 Customers who pay well and demand premium support for it. When responding, avoid excuses and just get to the solution. Consider creating a VIP folder and workflow to make it easy to identify and respond to their complaints.</p> <p>\u00b7 Customers who contact you frequently. Stay patient and avoid coming across as frustrated when responding to these customers. When satisfied, they often become repeat customers and advocates for your company.</p> <p>\u00b7 Customers who don't want to complain and may just take their business elsewhere without ever letting you know there was a problem. You'll have to actively reach out to these customers to solicit and resolve their complaints; otherwise, you may never hear their feedback. These are broad descriptions and, of course, your customers will present a more complex mixture of motivations and behaviors, but being aware of different persona types can help you respond most appropriately to the real person you are assisting.</p> <p>Step 3: Respond to the customer quickly</p> <ul> <li> <p>When it comes to unhappy customers, a speedy response goes from being a nice-to-have to a necessity. Complaints are best resolved as soon as possible.</p> </li> <li> <p>A customer leaving a feature request won\u2019t mind at all if it takes you a day to respond, but customers who are in a \u201cpulling my hair out\u201d situation want a resolution yesterday. Make responding to them a priority.</p> </li> <li> <p>It can be useful to set up a folder that's separate from the main support queue where you can filter less-than-ecstatic messages. Here, the team can see immediately which emails are from customers who need help right away.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Step 4: Present a solution, and verify that the problem is solved</p> <p>After you've identified the root cause of the customer's complaint, found a solution, and sent that solution to the customer, it's important to verify that the solution you proposed actually solved the problem. There are a couple of ways to do this:</p> <p>\u00b7 If you can't verify that the solution is working, add this line to the end of your communication: \"Please let me know if there's anything else I can do for you. I'm happy to help!\"</p> <p>\u00b7 Verify that the solution is working, then reply with: \"I've tested this myself and it all appears to be working as expected, which you can see here: (include screenshot). But please let me know if you're still running into issues.\"</p> <ul> <li> <p>In some cases, it may even be worth reaching back out to the customer after a few days have passed to make sure that everything is resolved.</p> </li> <li> <p>You may also want to consider monitoring any satisfaction ratings you receive on the conversation in your customer service software. Negative feedback may be a sign that there are still issues that need to be addressed (though there will be times that you've done everything you can do and the customer will still leave upset).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Step 5: Log the complaint so you can track trends</p> <ul> <li> <p>If you've gotten one complaint from one customer about one specific issue over the last 10 years, that issue might not be worth addressing. But if you're getting multiple messages from multiple customers who all shared the same complaint, that's the beginning of a narrative.</p> </li> <li> <p>To identify high-volume complaints, you'll need a system for tracking them. At Help Scout, we use the Help Scout + Jira integration to track customer complaints so we can capture them, monitor how often we're hearing recurring concerns, and follow up with each customer directly when the issue has been resolved.</p> </li> <li> <p>Whatever system you use, the key is to make it easy to capture meaningful complaints and track the volume of customers who are bringing up similar or identical issues.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"14/#how-to-handle-negativity-as-a-support-professional","title":"How to handle negativity as a support professional","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Handling customer complaints is just par for the course for support professionals, but that doesn't mean it won't take a toll on you emotionally from time to time.</p> </li> <li> <p>So in addition to providing you with a process for handling customer complaints, we wanted to share these tips from Jeremey DuVall, Support Engineer at WordPress VIP, on how to keep yourself from feeling down on days when there's lots of negativity in the queue.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"14/#rehearse-objections-ahead-of-time","title":"Rehearse objections ahead of time","text":"<ul> <li>By rehearsing potential objections ahead of time, you can prepare before real-life negative interactions occur.

Introduction to Positive Language and Phrasing","text":"<ul> <li>Positive language is a communication approach that focuses on using words and phrases that convey optimism, encouragement, and support. It emphasizes the use of affirmative and uplifting language to inspire confidence, build rapport, and foster positive relationships. In this introduction, we'll explore the significance of positive language in communication, the psychological principles underlying its impact, and the concept of reframing and its role in shaping perceptions through language.</li> </ul> <p>Significance of Positive Language in Communication:</p> <ul> <li>Positive language plays a crucial role in shaping the tone and atmosphere of interactions, influencing how messages are perceived and received by others. By using words and phrases that are optimistic, affirming, and constructive, communicators can create a more supportive and empowering environment. Positive language enhances understanding, fosters cooperation, and strengthens relationships, leading to more effective communication outcomes and improved overall well-being.</li> </ul> <p>Psychological Principles Underlying the Impact of Positive Language:</p> <ul> <li>The impact of positive language is rooted in various psychological principles, including the positivity bias, self-fulfilling prophecies, and the Pygmalion effect. The positivity bias refers to the human tendency to focus more on positive information and experiences than negative ones, making positive language more engaging and memorable. Self-fulfilling prophecies occur when beliefs or expectations about outcomes influence behavior in a way that confirms those beliefs, highlighting the importance of framing messages in a positive and empowering manner. The Pygmalion effect suggests that people tend to perform better when they are treated as if they are capable and competent, demonstrating the power of positive reinforcement and encouragement in shaping behavior and outcomes.</li> </ul> <p>Concept of Reframing and Its Role in Shaping Perceptions through Language:</p> <ul> <li>Reframing involves changing the way a situation is perceived by shifting the focus, context, or interpretation of the information presented. It allows communicators to highlight the positive aspects of a situation, challenge negative assumptions, and promote alternative perspectives. By reframing language, communicators can influence how others perceive and interpret messages, leading to more positive attitudes, emotions, and behaviors. Reframing is a valuable communication skill that enables individuals to turn challenges into opportunities, setbacks into learning experiences, and conflicts into opportunities for growth and resolution.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"18/#2-psychological-impact-of-positive-language","title":"2.

Customer Communication","text":"<p>Effective communication is paramount in customer service as it forms the foundation of positive interactions between businesses and their customers. Here's why it's so crucial: Understanding Customer Needs:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Effective communication allows customer service representatives to delve into the nuances of customer inquiries. By actively listening to customers, representatives can discern not only the surface-level issue but also the underlying concerns and preferences. This deeper understanding enables representatives to tailor their responses and solutions to better meet the individual needs of each customer, ultimately enhancing the overall customer experience.</p> </li> <li> <p>Building Trust and Rapport: Clear and empathetic communication forms the cornerstone of trust and rapport between businesses and their customers. When customers feel heard, understood, and valued, they are more likely to develop a sense of trust in the company. This trust lays the foundation for long-term relationships, as customers are more inclined to remain loyal to businesses that prioritize open, honest, and respectful communication.</p> </li> <li> <p>Resolving Issues Efficiently: Effective communication is instrumental in swiftly resolving customer issues and concerns. By employing active listening techniques and asking probing questions, representatives can gather all the necessary information to diagnose problems accurately. Clear and concise communication ensures that solutions are conveyed in a manner that is easy for customers to understand, minimizing confusion and expediting the resolution process. This efficiency not only saves time for both the customer and the company but also enhances overall satisfaction by demonstrating a commitment to addressing customer needs promptly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Managing Expectations: Transparent communication is essential for managing customer expectations effectively. By providing clear and accurate information about products, services, policies, and timelines, businesses can prevent misunderstandings and mitigate potential sources of dissatisfaction. Honest communication about what customers can expect in terms of product performance, delivery times, or service outcomes fosters realistic expectations, which are more likely to be met, thereby reducing the likelihood of disappointment or frustration.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Now, let's examine how these principles manifest in the examples provided:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Good Communication: Example: In the scenario where a customer informs a restaurant server about their food allergy, the server's active listening skills enable them to grasp the severity of the allergy and convey this information accurately to the kitchen staff. By doing so, the restaurant demonstrates its commitment to customer safety and satisfaction, building trust and rapport with the customer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Bad Communication: Example: In the case of a customer contacting a software company's support hotline, the representative's failure to actively listen and empathize with the customer's issue results in a lack of clarity and frustration. This breakdown in communication not only hinders the resolution process but also erodes the customer's confidence in the company's ability to provide effective support.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"20/","title":"20.

Practice incorporating these words into your everyday speech to enhance clarity and precision in communication.</p> </li> <li> <p>Storytelling Practice: Engage in storytelling exercises where you craft and share personal anecdotes or narratives. Focus on structuring your stories coherently, using descriptive language, and engaging your audience's attention.</p> </li> <li> <p>Debating Workshops: Participate in debating workshops or clubs where you can hone your argumentation and persuasion skills. Engage in structured debates on various topics to practice articulating your thoughts persuasively and respectfully.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Non-verbal Communication:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Non-verbal cues such as facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice play a significant role in communication. Pay attention to your own non-verbal signals and be mindful of the messages they convey. Similarly, observe the non-verbal cues of others to gauge their reactions and feelings, allowing you to adjust your communication approach accordingly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Non-verbal communication serves as a powerful complement to verbal messages, often conveying emotions and intentions more vividly than words alone. By being attuned to their own non-verbal cues, individuals can ensure that their body language and tone align with their intended message, enhancing the clarity and effectiveness of their communication. Moreover, being mindful of non-verbal signals enables communicators to convey sincerity and authenticity, fostering trust and rapport with their audience.</p> </li> <li> <p>Additionally, observing the non-verbal cues of others provides valuable insights into their thoughts, feelings, and reactions. By paying attention to facial expressions, gestures, and posture, communicators can gauge the listener's level of engagement and adjust their approach accordingly. This adaptability allows for more responsive and empathetic communication, ensuring that messages resonate with the audience on a deeper level. Overall, non-verbal communication enriches the exchange of information and contributes to more meaningful and impactful interactions.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Tone of Voice:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Pitch and Intonation Practice: Practice varying your pitch and intonation to convey different emotions and messages. Record yourself reading passages with different emotional tones, such as excitement, concern, or determination, and listen back to assess your effectiveness.</p> </li> <li> <p>Role-playing Difficult Conversations: Engage in role-playing exercises where you simulate challenging scenarios requiring different tones of voice, such as delivering constructive feedback, resolving conflicts, or negotiating agreements. Experiment with adjusting your tone to achieve desired outcomes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Voice Modulation Exercises: Practice voice modulation exercises, such as vocal warm-ups and breathing techniques, to develop greater control and flexibility in your tone of voice. Experiment with adjusting volume, pace, and emphasis to convey nuances in meaning and emotion.</p> </li> <li> <p>Communicating clearly and concisely is crucial for ensuring that your message is understood correctly. Use simple language and avoid jargon or technical terms that may confuse the listener. Organize your thoughts logically and present information in a structured manner to enhance comprehension.</p> </li> <li> <p>Clarity and conciseness in communication not only facilitate understanding but also demonstrate respect for the listener's time and attention. When messages are clear and concise, listeners can grasp the main points quickly, reducing the risk of misinterpretation or confusion. This clarity is especially important in professional settings where efficiency and accuracy are paramount.</p> </li> <li> <p>Furthermore, using simple language and avoiding unnecessary complexity enhances inclusivity, ensuring that the message is accessible to a wider audience. By eliminating jargon or technical terms, communicators can reach individuals with varying levels of expertise or background knowledge, promoting broader understanding and engagement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Moreover, organizing thoughts logically and presenting information in a structured manner enhances the coherence and coherence of the message. Clear structure guides the listener through the communication process, making it easier to follow the flow of ideas and discern the intended meaning. Whether written or verbal, well-structured communication enables listeners to absorb information more effectively, leading to more productive interactions and outcomes.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Active Listening:  - Active listening goes beyond simply hearing the words spoken; it requires a deeper level of engagement and understanding. One aspect of active listening often overlooked is the ability to read between the lines and understand the speaker's emotions, tone, and body language. This allows the listener to grasp the full context of the message and respond appropriately.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Moreover, active listening involves empathizing with the speaker, acknowledging their feelings, and validating their experiences. By demonstrating empathy, listeners create a supportive environment where individuals feel heard and understood, fostering trust and rapport.</p> </li> <li> <p>Furthermore, active listening involves asking probing questions to clarify points, demonstrate interest, and encourage the speaker to elaborate on their thoughts and feelings. These questions show that the listener is actively engaged and interested in the conversation, facilitating deeper dialogue and understanding.</p> </li> <li> <p>Additionally, active listening requires suspending judgment and refraining from formulating responses while the speaker is talking. Instead, listeners focus on fully comprehending the speaker's message before formulating a thoughtful response. This approach promotes open-mindedness and encourages the exploration of different perspectives.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lastly, active listening is an ongoing process that requires practice and continuous refinement. By honing active listening skills, individuals can improve their communication abilities, build stronger relationships, and navigate conflicts more effectively.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Empathy and Understanding:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Empathy involves understanding and sharing the feelings and perspectives of others. By putting yourself in the other person's shoes, you can better appreciate their viewpoint and respond with compassion and sensitivity. Demonstrating empathy fosters trust and rapport, leading to more meaningful and productive interactions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Empathy is a cornerstone of effective communication as it cultivates a deeper connection between individuals. Beyond simply acknowledging the emotions of others, empathy encourages individuals to actively listen and validate those feelings, creating a safe space for open dialogue and mutual understanding. This emotional validation fosters trust and strengthens interpersonal relationships, laying the foundation for meaningful collaboration and cooperation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Furthermore, empathy enables individuals to transcend their own biases and preconceptions, allowing them to approach interactions with an open mind and genuine curiosity. By seeking to understand the perspectives and experiences of others, communicators can broaden their own worldview and develop a more nuanced understanding of complex issues. This empathetic approach not only enhances communication but also promotes empathy and compassion within broader social contexts, fostering a more inclusive and supportive community.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Feedback and Clarification: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Seeking feedback and clarification during conversations helps ensure mutual understanding and prevents misunderstandings. Encourage others to ask questions and provide input, and be open to receiving feedback yourself. Clarify any points of confusion or ambiguity promptly to avoid miscommunication.</p> </li> <li> <p>Seeking feedback and clarification demonstrates a commitment to effective communication and mutual respect within conversations. Encouraging others to ask questions and provide input fosters an environment of collaboration and shared understanding. By actively soliciting feedback, communicators demonstrate humility and openness to different perspectives, enriching the exchange of ideas and promoting constructive dialogue.</p> </li> <li> <p>Moreover, being receptive to feedback yourself is essential for personal and professional growth. Embracing constructive criticism with an open mind allows individuals to identify areas for improvement and refine their communication skills over time. Additionally, acknowledging and addressing points of confusion or ambiguity promptly helps prevent misunderstandings from escalating and reinforces the integrity of the communication process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Furthermore, clarification not only ensures mutual understanding but also strengthens trust and transparency in relationships. By proactively seeking clarification when needed and providing clear explanations when asked, communicators demonstrate their commitment to clarity and accountability. This proactive approach to communication fosters stronger connections and facilitates smoother interactions, ultimately leading to more effective collaboration and problem-solving.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Adaptability and Flexibility: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Effective communicators are adaptable and able to adjust their communication style to suit the needs and preferences of their audience. Recognize that different people may require different approaches to communication, and be willing to adapt accordingly. Flexibility promotes inclusivity and enables more effective communication across diverse contexts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adaptability and flexibility in communication are essential for navigating diverse environments and engaging with a wide range of individuals effectively. By recognizing that different people may have unique communication preferences, effective communicators can tailor their approach to accommodate various styles and perspectives. This adaptability fosters inclusivity and ensures that all voices are heard and valued in the communication process, promoting a sense of belonging and respect within the group.</p> </li> <li> <p>Furthermore, being willing to adapt your communication style demonstrates a commitment to understanding and meeting the needs of your audience. Whether it's adjusting your tone, language, or delivery method, flexibility allows communicators to connect with their audience more authentically and foster deeper engagement. This willingness to adapt not only enhances comprehension but also cultivates empathy and mutual respect, laying the groundwork for more meaningful and productive interactions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Moreover, flexibility enables effective communicators to navigate challenging situations and unexpected obstacles with grace and composure. By remaining open to new ideas and perspectives, communicators can pivot seamlessly in response to changing circumstances, maintaining clarity and coherence in their messaging. This agility enhances resilience and facilitates smoother communication, even in the face of uncertainty or adversity, ultimately strengthening relationships and driving positive outcomes.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Constructive Conflict Resolution: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Conflict is inevitable in any relationship or group setting, but effective communication can help resolve conflicts constructively. Approach conflicts with an open mind and a willingness to listen to the perspectives of all parties involved. Focus on finding common ground and mutually acceptable solutions rather than escalating tensions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Constructive conflict resolution hinges on fostering a collaborative atmosphere where all parties feel heard and respected. This requires creating a safe space for open dialogue, where individuals can express their viewpoints without fear of judgment or reprisal. By cultivating an environment of trust and transparency, effective communicators encourage constructive engagement and facilitate the resolution of conflicts in a fair and equitable manner.</p> </li> <li> <p>Furthermore, effective communication during conflict resolution involves active listening and empathy, allowing individuals to understand the underlying needs and motivations driving each party's perspective. By demonstrating genuine interest in the concerns of others and acknowledging their feelings and experiences, communicators can build empathy and rapport, paving the way for mutual understanding and reconciliation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Moreover, effective conflict resolution requires a focus on problem-solving rather than blame or retribution. By reframing conflicts as opportunities for growth and collaboration, communicators can shift the focus from past grievances to future-oriented solutions. This proactive approach encourages creativity and innovation, empowering individuals to explore new possibilities and chart a path forward that meets the needs of all stakeholders involved.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"6/","title":"6.

These factors have the biggest influence on the customer experience. - Personalized: Good customer service always starts with a human touch. Personalized interactions greatly improve customer service and let customers know that your company cares about them and their problems. Instead of thinking of service as a cost, consider it an opportunity to earn your customer\u2019s business all over again.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Competent: Consumers have identified competency as the element that plays the biggest role in a good customer experience. To be competent, a customer support professional must have a strong knowledge of the company and its products, as well as the power to fix the customer\u2019s problems. The more knowledge they have, the more competent they become.</p> </li> <li> <p>Convenient: Customers want to be able to get in touch with a customer service representative through whichever channel is the most convenient for them. Offer support through the channels of communication your customers rely on most, and make it easy for customers to figure out how to contact you.</p> </li> <li> <p>Proactive: Customers want companies to be proactive in reaching out to them. If one of your products is backordered or your website is going to experience downtime, proactively reach out to your customers and explain the problem. They may not be happy about the situation, but they will be thankful that you kept them in the loop.</p> </li> </ul> <p>By building your customer service strategy around these four main principles, you'll create a positive, hassle-free customer experience for everyone who deals with your company.*</p>"},{"location":"6/#21-key-customer-service-skills","title":"21 key customer service skills","text":"<ul> <li>While delivering consistently good customer service requires work and alignment across your entire organization, a good place to start is your customer service team. It's important to hire people who genuinely want to help your customers succeed \u2014 and to pay rates that are attractive to skilled professionals.</li> <li>Finding the perfect hire for a support team can be challenging. No particular checklist of job experiences and college diplomas adds up to the perfect candidate. Instead, you\u2019re looking for qualities that can\u2019t necessarily be taught.</li> <li>These folks thrive on one-on-one interactions within their community. They love problem solving. They\u2019re warm, approachable, and great at teaching other people how things work.</li> <li>Here are the 21 customer service skills that every support professional should seek to develop and every leader should look for when hiring new team members.</li> </ul> <p>1. Problem solving skills</p> <ul> <li>Customers do not always self-diagnose their issues correctly. Often, it\u2019s up to the support rep to take the initiative to reproduce the trouble at hand before navigating a solution. That means they need to intuit not just what went wrong, but also what action the customer was ultimately after.</li> <li>A great example? If somebody writes in because they\u2019re having trouble resetting their password, that\u2019s ultimately because they want to log into their account.</li> <li>A good customer service interaction will anticipate that need and might even go the extra mile to manually perform the reset and provide new login details, all while educating the customer on how they can do it for themselves in the future.</li> <li>In other situations, a problem-solving pro may simply understand how to offer preemptive advice or a solution that the customer doesn\u2019t even realize is an option.</li> </ul> <p>2. Patience</p> <ul> <li>Patience is crucial for customer service professionals. After all, customers who reach out to support are often confused and frustrated. Being listened to and handled with patience goes a long way in helping customers feel like you\u2019re going to alleviate their current frustrations.</li> <li>It\u2019s not enough to close out interactions with customers as quickly as possible. Your team has to be willing to take the time to listen to and fully understand each customer\u2019s problems and needs.</li> </ul> <p>3. Attentiveness</p> <ul> <li>The ability to truly listen to customers is crucial to providing great service for a number of reasons. Not only is it important to pay attention to individual customers\u2019 experiences, but it\u2019s also important to be mindful and attentive to the feedback that you receive at large.</li> <li>For instance, customers may not be saying it outright, but perhaps there is a pervasive feeling that your software\u2019s dashboard isn\u2019t laid out correctly. Customers aren\u2019t likely to say, \u201cPlease improve your UX,\u201d but they may say things like, \u201cI can never find the search feature\u201d or \u201cWhere is (specific function), again?\u201d</li> <li>You have to be attentive to pick up on what customers are telling you without directly saying it.</li> </ul> <p>4. Emotional intelligence</p> <ul> <li>A great customer support representative knows how to relate to anybody, but they\u2019re especially good with frustrated people. Instead of taking things personally, they intuitively understand where the other person is coming from and they know to both prioritize and swiftly communicate that empathy.</li> <li>Think about it: How often have you felt better about a potential grievance simply because you felt immediately heard by the other person involved?</li> <li>When a support rep is able to demonstrate sincere empathy for a frustrated customer, even just by reiterating the problem at hand, it can help to both placate (the customer feels heard) and actively please (the customer feel validated in their frustration).</li> </ul> <p>5. Clear communication skills</p> <ul> <li>Your customer support team is on the front lines of problem solving for the product itself, and serves as a kind of two-pronged bullhorn.</li> <li>On one side, they\u2019ll be the voice of your company to your customers. That means they have to have a practiced grasp on how to reduce complex concepts into highly digestible, easily understood terms.</li> <li>On the other, they\u2019ll represent the needs and thoughts of customers to your company. For example, it doesn\u2019t behoove the customer to receive a long- winded explanation on the ins-and-outs of solving a particular bug.</li> <li>The ability to communicate clearly when working with customers is a key skill because miscommunications can result in disappointment and frustration. The best customer service professionals know how to keep their communications with customers simple and leave nothing to doubt.</li> </ul> <p>6. Writing skills</p> <ul> <li>Good writing means getting as close to reality as words will allow. Without an ounce of exaggeration, being a good writer is the most overlooked, yet most necessary, skill to look for when it comes to hiring for customer support.</li> <li>Unlike face-to-face (or even voice-to-voice) interactions, writing requires a unique ability to convey nuance. How a sentence is phrased can make the difference between sounding kind of like a jerk (\u201cYou have to log out first\u201d) and sounding like you care (\u201cLogging out should help solve that problem quickly!\u201d).</li> <li>Good writers also tend to use complete sentences and proper grammar \u2014 qualities that subtly gesture toward the security and trustworthiness of your company.</li> <li>Even if your company offers support primarily over the phone, writing skills are still important. Not only will they enable your team to craft coherent internal documentation, they signify a person who thinks and communicates clearly.</li> </ul> <p>7. Creativity and resourcefulness</p> <ul> <li>Solving the problem is good, but finding clever and fun ways to go the extra mile \u2014 and wanting to do so in the first place \u2014 is even better.</li> <li>It takes panache to infuse a typical customer service exchange with memorable warmth and personality, and finding a customer service rep who possesses that natural zeal will take your customer service out of \u201cgood enough\u201d territory and straight into \u201ctell all your friends about it\u201d land.</li> <li>Chase Clemons at Basecamp advises the following:</li> <li>\u201cYou want to have somebody who you don\u2019t have to give a lot of rules and regulations to. You want to have somebody who is talking to a customer and understands \u2018Their boss is really yelling at them today. This person is having a really bad day. You know what? I\u2019m going to send them some flowers to brighten things up.\u2019 That\u2019s not really something you can teach. They have to go the extra mile naturally.\u201d</li> </ul> <p>8. Persuasion skills</p> <ul> <li>Oftentimes, support teams get messages from people who aren\u2019t looking for support \u2014 they\u2019re considering purchasing your company\u2019s product.</li> <li>In these situations, it helps to have a team of people with some mastery of persuasion so they can convince interested prospects that your product is right for them (if it truly is).</li> <li>It\u2019s not about making a sales pitch in each email, but it is about not letting potential customers slip away because you couldn\u2019t create a compelling message that your company\u2019s product is worth purchasing!</li> </ul> <p>9. Ability to use positive language</p> <ul> <li>Effective customer service means having the ability to make minor changes in your conversational patterns. This can truly go a long way in creating happy customers.</li> <li>Language is a crucial part of persuasion, and people (especially customers) create perceptions about you and your company based on the language that you use.</li> <li>For example, let\u2019s say a customer contacts your team with an interest in a particular product, but that product happens to be back-ordered until next month.</li> <li>Responding to questions with positive language can greatly affect how the customer hears the response:<ul> <li>Without positive language: \u201cI can\u2019t get you that product until next month; it is back-ordered and unavailable at this time.\u201d</li> <li>With positive language: \u201cThat product will be available next month. I can place the order for you right now and make sure that it is sent to you as soon as it reaches our warehouse.\u201d</li> </ul> </li> <li>The first example isn\u2019t negative per se, but the tone it conveys feels abrupt and impersonal and could be taken the wrong way by customers \u2014 especially in email support when the perception of written language can skew negative.</li> <li>Conversely, the second example is stating the same thing (the item is unavailable), but it focuses on when and how the issue will be resolved instead of focusing on the negative.</li> </ul> <p>10.  Product knowledge</p> <ul> <li>The best customer service professionals have a deep knowledge of how their companies\u2019 products work. After all, without knowing your product from front to back, they won\u2019t know how to help when customers run into problems.</li> <li>All new Help Scout employees, for example, are trained on customer support during their first or second week on the job; it\u2019s a critical component of our employee onboarding process.</li> <li>According to Help Scout's Elyse Roach, \u201cHaving that solid product foundation not only ensures you\u2019ve got the best tricks up your sleeve to help customers navigate even the most complex situations, it also helps you build an understanding of their experience so that you can become their strongest advocate.\u201d</li> </ul> <p>11.  Acting skills</p> <ul> <li>Sometimes your team is going to come across people who you\u2019ll never be able to make happy.</li> <li>Situations outside of your control (such as a customer who's having a terrible day) will sometimes creep into your team's usual support routine.</li> <li>Every great customer service professional needs basic acting skills to maintain their usual cheery persona in spite of dealing with people who are just plain grumpy.</li> </ul> <p>12.  Time management skills</p> <ul> <li>On the one hand, it\u2019s good to be patient and spend a little extra time with customers to understand their problems and needs. On the other hand, there is a limit to the amount of time you can dedicate to each customer, so your team needs to be concerned with getting customers what they want in an efficient manner.</li> <li>The best customer service professionals are quick to recognize when they can't help a customer so they can quickly get that customer to someone who can help.</li> </ul> <p>13.  Ability to read customers</p> <ul> <li>It's important that your team understands some basic principles of behavioral psychology in order to read customers' current emotional states. As Emily Triplett Lentz writes:</li> <li>\u201cI rarely use a smiley face in a support email when the customer\u2019s signature includes \u2018PhD,\u2019 for example. Not that academics are humorless, it's just that :) isn\u2019t likely to get you taken seriously by someone who spent five years deconstructing utopian undertones in nineteenth-century autobiographical fiction.\u201d</li> <li>The best support pros know how to watch and listen for subtle clues about a customer's current mood, patience level, personality, etc., which goes a long way in keeping customer interactions positive.</li> </ul> <p>14.  Unflappability</p> <ul> <li>There are a lot of metaphors for this type of personality \u2014 \u201ckeeps their cool,\u201d \u201cstaying cool under pressure,\u201d and so on \u2014 but it all represents the same thing: The ability some people have to stay calm and even influence others when things get a little hectic.</li> <li>The best customer service reps know that they can\u2019t let a heated customer force them to lose their cool. In fact, it is their job to try to be the \u201crock\u201d for customers who think the world is falling apart as a result of their current problems.</li> </ul> <p>15.  Goal-oriented focus</p> <ul> <li>Many customer service experts have shown how giving employees unfettered power to \u201cwow\u201d customers doesn\u2019t always generate the returns many businesses expect to see. That\u2019s because it leaves employees without goals, and business goals and customer happiness can work hand-in-hand without resulting in poor service.</li> <li>Relying on frameworks like the Net Promoter Score can help businesses come up with guidelines for their employees that allow plenty of freedom to handle customers on a case-to-case basis, but also leave them priority solutions and \u201cgo-to\u201d fixes for common problems.</li> </ul> <p>16.  Ability to handle surprises</p> <ul> <li>Sometimes, customers are going to throw your team curveballs. They'll make a request that isn't covered in your company guidelines or react in a way that no one could have expected.</li> <li>In these situations, it's good to have a team of people who can think on their feet. Even better, look for people who will take the initiative to create guidelines for everyone to use in these situations moving forward.</li> </ul> <p>17.  Tenacity</p> <ul> <li>Call it what you want, but a great work ethic and a willingness to do what needs to be done (and not take shortcuts) is a key skill when providing the kind of service that people talk (positively) about.</li> <li>The most memorable customer service stories out there \u2014 many of which had a huge impact on the business \u2014 were created by a single employee who refused to just follow the standard process when it came to helping someone out.</li> </ul> <p>18.  Closing ability</p> <ul> <li>Being able to close with a customer as a customer service professional means being able to end the conversation with confirmed customer satisfaction (or as close to it as you can achieve) and with the customer feeling that everything has been taken care of (or will be).</li> <li>Getting booted before all of their problems have been addressed is the last thing that customers want, so be sure your team knows to take the time to confirm with customers that each and every issue they had was entirely resolved.</li> </ul> <p>19.  Empathy</p> <ul> <li>Perhaps empathy \u2014 the ability to understand and share the feelings of another \u2014 is more of a character trait than a skill. But since empathy can be learned and improved upon, we\u2019d be remiss not to include it here.</li> <li>In fact, if your organization tests job applicants for customer service aptitude, you\u2019d be hard pressed to look for a more critical skill than empathy.</li> <li>That\u2019s because even when you can\u2019t tell the customer exactly what they want to hear, a dose of care, concern, and understanding will go a long way. A support rep\u2019s ability to empathize with a customer and craft a message that steers things toward a better outcome can often make all the difference.</li> </ul> <p>20.  A methodical approach</p> <ul> <li>In customer service, haste makes waste. Hiring deliberate, detail-oriented people will go a long way in meeting the needs of your customers.</li> <li>One, they\u2019ll be sure to get to the real heart of a problem before firing off a reply. There\u2019s nothing worse than attempting a \u201csolution,\u201d only to have it miss the mark entirely on solving the actual issue.</li> <li>Two, they\u2019ll proofread. A thoughtfully written response can lose a lot of its problem-solving luster if it\u2019s riddled with typos.</li> <li>Three, and this one may be the most important, it means they\u2019ll regularly follow up. There\u2019s nothing more impressive than getting a note from a customer service rep saying, \u201cHey! Remember that bug you found that I said we were looking into? Well, we fixed it.\u201d That\u2019s a loyal, lifetime customer you\u2019ve just earned.</li> <li>An important side note: The best hires are able to maintain their methodical grace under regular fire.</li> <li>Since the support team is often tasked with the tough work of cleaning up other people\u2019s messes, it\u2019s especially important they understand how not to internalize the urgency \u2014 and potential ire \u2014 of frustrated customers. Instead, they know how to keep a cool head and a steady, guiding hand.</li> </ul> <p>21.  Willingness to learn</p> <ul> <li>While this is probably the most general skill on this list, it\u2019s also one of the most important. After all, willingness to learn is the basis for growing skills as a customer service professional.</li> <li>Your team members have to be willing to learn your product inside and out, willing to learn how to communicate better (and when they're communicating poorly), willing to learn when it\u2019s okay to follow a process \u2014 and when it\u2019s more appropriate to choose their own adventures.</li> <li>Those who don\u2019t seek to improve what they do \u2014 whether it\u2019s building products, marketing businesses, or helping customers \u2014 will get left behind by the people who are willing to invest in their own skills.</li> </ul> <p>22.  Meeting Customer Needs</p> <ul> <li>Meeting customer needs involves understanding their preferences, expectations, and pain points. This requires active listening, empathy, and a customer-centric approach to problem-solving.</li> <li>Businesses can gather feedback through surveys, social media monitoring, and direct customer interactions to identify areas for improvement and tailor their products or services to better meet customer needs.</li> </ul> <p>Providing Timely Responses:</p> <ul> <li>Timely responses are essential for maintaining customer satisfaction and loyalty. In today's fast-paced world, customers expect quick resolutions to their inquiries and issues.</li> <li>Implementing efficient communication channels, such as live chat support, chatbots, and dedicated customer service teams, can help businesses respond promptly to customer queries and provide timely assistance.</li> </ul> <p>Going Above and Beyond Expectations:</p> <ul> <li>Going above and beyond expectations involves delivering memorable experiences that exceed what customers anticipate. This could involve personalized recommendations, unexpected perks, or proactive problem-solving.</li> <li>By delighting customers with unexpected gestures of kindness or generosity, businesses can leave a lasting impression and foster strong customer loyalty and advocacy.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"6/#real-life-examples-of-exceptional-customer-service","title":"Real-life Examples of Exceptional Customer Service","text":"<p>Walt Disney World:    - Walt Disney World is renowned for its legendary customer service, known as \"Disney Magic.\" In one instance, a young boy lost his stuffed Duffy bear at the park.

No, sympathy reflects sharing the emotions of someone else, while empathy reflects understanding and perspective sharing of someone else.</p> </li> <li> <p>Indeed, empathy can be categorized into three types, each with its own characteristics and levels of depth. Here's a breakdown of the three types of empathy:</p> </li> <li> <p>Cognitive Empathy: This type of empathy refers to the ability to understand and recognize the emotions and perspectives of others. It involves putting yourself in someone else's shoes and gaining a surface-level understanding of their feelings or situation. In customer service, cognitive empathy helps representatives empathize with customers' needs and concerns, allowing them to provide appropriate recommendations or responses.</p> </li> <li> <p>Emotional Empathy: Emotional empathy goes beyond understanding someone else's feelings and involves sharing and experiencing those emotions yourself. In customer service, emotional empathy allows representatives to connect with customers on a deeper level, feeling and acknowledging their emotional burden. This type of empathy enables customer service leaders to support and console team members after challenging customer interactions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Compassionate Empathy: Compassionate empathy takes empathy to another level by combining understanding with action. It involves not only recognizing and sharing the emotions of others but also taking practical steps to address and resolve their pain or challenges. In customer service, compassionate empathy is the pinnacle of empathetic behavior. Customer service representatives who can reach this level can effectively connect with customers, understand their needs and frustrations, and take prompt and proactive measures to resolve their issues swiftly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Understanding and developing these different types of empathy is crucial for customer service professionals.

To diagnose the cause of the problem, you can ask questions relevant to when the problem started, what products or services were involved, what methods were used to troubleshoot the issue, and if the issue has ever occurred before. Record your answers to each question until you arrive at a list of potential solutions. With these answers, you can go through the same process of asking questions step by step until you identify the most appropriate solution.</li> </ul> <p>Flowchart</p> <p>A flow chart is a diagram you can use to represent the divisions of a problem or the steps of a business process. To create a flowchart, write the title of the problem in the middle of the page or whiteboard and draw a circle around it. Outline the various processes, such as the purchasing of the product, payment method, customer complaint, errors associated with the product, and results of a quality check. Outlining the processes using a flowchart can help you visualize the cause of the problem and in which process it occurred.</p> <p>Benchmarking</p> <p>Benchmarking refers to comparing various business processes and outcomes with other successful companies to see how each measure compares. Benchmarking can typically contrast specific processes or outcomes, such as customer satisfaction, product quality, sales, profit margin, and return on investment. Different types of benchmarks can show how your processes compare with other leading companies. Performance benchmarking can also help you identify strengths and weaknesses in key performance indicators (KPIs). Each comparison metric for KPIs can highlight areas in your processes or in individual performances so you can improve and address techniques for improving.</p> <p>Five Whys</p> <p>The five whys strategy involves asking why five times in succession to produce a potential solution to a problem. For example, if product quality assurance checks are finding more frequent production errors, you start by asking why and recording the answer. If you notice one piece of equipment required service maintenance recently, write this as one of your answers. Once you have a list of potential solutions, you ask the same question again for each answer you gave in the previous section. Continue this process five times in succession or until you determine an effective countermeasure to implement.</p> <p>Goals grid</p> <p>A goals grid is a diagram with four quadrants where you can record your answers to a series of questions. Typically, questions relate to what you want but don't have, what you have and want to preserve, what you don't have and don't want, and what you have but don't want. You can create a list of bullet points for each question.</p> <p>For example, in the section where you outline what you want but don't have, you might write about launching new international products or services. In the second quadrant, you might write about incurring excess marketing costs and late customer payments for things you don't have and want to continue avoiding. For the problem-solving process, your four quadrants might represent values such as what a potential solution might include, what processes the problem involves, and how you can avoid this problem in the future.</p> <p>Mind map</p> <p>A mind map is a diagram that starts with a central concept or idea that you can derive ideas from and visualize the various components to make connections. The goal of a mind map is to create a visual representation of the aspects of a problem so you can highlight important elements so you brainstorm more solutions. Start by writing your concept in the middle of the page and drawing a circle around it. Then, draw a line connecting the central idea with an aspect or subcategory of what you want to explore, and continue this process until you outline each relevant component. You may also derive new branches from subheadings if you want to elaborate further on the idea or feature.</p>"},{"location":"9/#root-cause-analysis","title":"Root cause analysis","text":"<p>Root cause analysis (RCA) is the process of discovering the root causes of problems in order to identify appropriate solutions. RCA assumes that it is much more effective to systematically prevent and solve for underlying issues rather than just treating ad hoc symptoms and putting out fires. Root cause analysis can be performed with a collection of principles, techniques, and methodologies that can all be leveraged to identify the root causes of an event or trend. Looking beyond superficial cause and effect, RCA can show where processes or systems failed or caused an issue in the first place.</p> <p>Core principles</p> <ul> <li> <p>There are a few core principles that guide effective root cause analysis, some of which should already be apparent. Not only will these help the analysis quality, these will also help the analyst gain trust and buy-in from stakeholders, clients, or patients.</p> </li> <li> <p>Focus on correcting and remedying root causes rather than just symptoms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don\u2019t ignore the importance of treating symptoms for short term relief.</p> </li> <li> <p>Realize there can be, and often are, multiple root causes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Focus on HOW and WHY something happened, not WHO was responsible.</p> </li> <li> <p>Be methodical and find concrete cause-effect evidence to back up root cause claims.</p> </li> <li> <p>Provide enough information to inform a corrective course of action.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider how a root cause can be prevented (or replicated) in the future.</p> </li> <li> <p>As the above principles illustrate: when we analyze deep issues and causes, it\u2019s important to take a comprehensive and holistic approach. In addition to discovering the root cause, we should strive to provide context and information that will result in an action or a decision. Remember: good analysis is actionable analysis.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Benefits and goals of root cause analysis</p> <p>The first goal of root cause analysis is to discover the root cause of a problem or event. The second goal is to fully understand how to fix, compensate, or learn from any underlying issues within the root cause. The third goal is to apply what we learn from this analysis to systematically prevent future issues or to repeat successes. Analysis is only as good as what we do with that analysis, so the third goal of RCA is important. We can use RCA to also modify core process and system issues in a way that prevents future problems. Instead of just treating the symptoms of a football player\u2019s concussion, for example, root cause analysis might suggest wearing a helmet to reduce the risk of future concussions. Treating the individual symptoms may feel productive. Solving a large number of problems looks like something is getting done. But if we don\u2019t actually diagnose the real root cause of a problem we\u2019ll likely have the same exact problem over and over. Instead of a news editor just fixing every single omitted Oxford comma, she will prevent further issues by training her writers to use commas properly in all future assignments.</p> <p>Problem-Solving Root Cause Analysis Tools</p> <p>The Ishikawa Fishbone Diagram (IFD)</p> <p>The model introduced by Ishikawa (also known as the fishbone diagram) is considered one of the most robust methods for conducting root cause analysis. This model uses the assessment of the 6Ms as a methodology for identifying the true or most probable root cause to determine corrective and preventive actions. The 6Ms include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Man</p> </li> <li> <p>Machine</p> </li> <li> <p>Methods</p> </li> <li> <p>Materials</p> </li> <li> <p>Measurement,</p> </li> <li> <p>Mother Nature- i.e., Environment</p> </li> </ul> <p>Pareto Chart</p> <p>The Pareto Chart is a series of bars whose heights reflect the frequency or impact of problems. On the Chart, bars are arranged in descending order of height from left to right, which means the categories represented by the tall bars on the left are relatively more frequent than those on the right.</p> <p>5 Whys</p> <p>This model uses the 5 Why by asking why 5 times to find the root cause of the problem. It generally takes five iterations of the questioning process to arrive at the root cause of the problem and that's why this model got its name as 5 Whys. But it is perfectly fine for a facilitator to ask less or more questions depending on the needs.</p> <p>Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) - FMEA is a technique used to identify process and product problems before they occur. It focuses on how and when a system will fail, not if it will fail. In this model, each failure mode is assessed for:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Severity (S)</p> </li> <li> <p>Occurrence (O)</p> </li> <li> <p>Detection (D)</p> </li> <li> <p>A combination of the three scores produces a risk priority number (RPN). The RPN is then provided a ranking system to prioritize which problem must gain more attention first.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Scatter Diagram</p> <ul> <li>A scatter diagram also known as a scatter plot is a graph in which the values of two variables are plotted along two axes, the pattern of the resulting points revealing any correlation present.To use scatter plots in root cause analysis, an independent variable or suspected cause is plotted on the x-axis and the dependent variable (the effect) is plotted on the y-axis. If the pattern reflects a clear curve or line, it means they are correlated. If required, more sophisticated correlation analyses can be continued.</li> </ul> <p>Affinity Diagram</p> <ul> <li>Also known as KJ Diagram, this model is used to represent the structure of big and complex factors that impact a problem or a situation. It divides these factors into small classifications according to their similarity to assist in identifying the major causes of the problem.</li> </ul> <p>Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)</p> <ul> <li> <p>The Fault Tree Analysis uses Boolean logic to arrive at the cause of a problem. It begins with a defined problem and works backward to identify what factors contributed to the problem using a graphical representation called the Fault Tree. It takes a top-down approach starting with the problem and evaluating the factors that caused the problem.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finding the root cause isn't an easy because there is not always one root cause. You may have to repeat your experiment several times to arrive at it to eliminate the encountered problem. Using a scientific approach to solving problem works. So, its important to learn the several problem-solving tools and techniques at your fingertips so you can use the ones appropriate for different situations.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Five steps of a root cause analysis</p> <p>Step 1. Define the problem.</p> <p>Step 2.Collect data.</p> <p>Step 3. Identify causal factors.</p> <p>Step 4. Identify root cause(s).</p> <p>Step 5. Implement solutions.</p> <p>Tips for Performing Effective Root Cause Analysis</p> <ul> <li> <p>Collaborate with other teams. Gain a diverse range of experiences and expertise by working with relevant people from other teams. They can likely offer different perspectives that will help to find the various causes of the problem.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don\u2019t play the blame game! Root cause analysis is a tool that helps you and your team overcome problems, but it shouldn\u2019t be used to criticize or blame someone. Instead, try to create a blame-free culture, so that your co-workers feel confident in sharing ideas and insights. This will help you to diagnose the issue quickly and effectively.</p> </li> <li> <p>Keep your questions open-ended. Leave any assumptions you have about the potential causes of the problem at the door. RCA is a chance to look at a problem with fresh eyes, so use open-ended questions as you work through the five steps. This will allow you to reveal things you didn\u2019t already know, and find the most effective solution.</p> </li> </ul>"}]}
