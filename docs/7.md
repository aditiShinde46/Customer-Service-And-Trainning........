# 7.Empathy Training

- “I see you.” “I hear you.” “I feel your pain.” These words settle the soul in a world filled with chaos.

- Customer service representatives call upon empathy in every interaction. But only the top customer service reps know how to use the power of empathy to build brand recognition and customer loyalty. 

- For growing companies handling customer service for the first time or looking to expand their team, training your team to empathize ensures a lifetime of happy customers. 

- The good news is that most customer service representatives naturally radiate empathy. If you’re attracted to the position, chances are you like people and feel a connection to others with or without a CSR job title. But, like all skills and talents, there’s always room for growth. 

- Let’s take a look at what empathy is, different types, and the role it plays in the workplace and for your company at large.

### **What is empathy?**

- Empathy is the ability to relate to another person’s situation and emotions, or perspective-taking. Developing empathy allows you to see from a different person’s perspective and support them in a unique way. The goal of empathy is to help someone to move on from a difficult emotion or to lift them out of a tough situation. It’s similar to emotional intelligence.

- Is empathy the same as sympathy? No, sympathy reflects sharing the emotions of someone else, while empathy reflects understanding and perspective sharing of someone else.

- Indeed, empathy can be categorized into three types, each with its own characteristics and levels of depth. Here's a breakdown of the three types of empathy:

- Cognitive Empathy: This type of empathy refers to the ability to understand and recognize the emotions and perspectives of others. It involves putting yourself in someone else's shoes and gaining a surface-level understanding of their feelings or situation. In customer service, cognitive empathy helps representatives empathize with customers' needs and concerns, allowing them to provide appropriate recommendations or responses.

- Emotional Empathy: Emotional empathy goes beyond understanding someone else's feelings and involves sharing and experiencing those emotions yourself. In customer service, emotional empathy allows representatives to connect with customers on a deeper level, feeling and acknowledging their emotional burden. This type of empathy enables customer service leaders to support and console team members after challenging customer interactions.

- Compassionate Empathy: Compassionate empathy takes empathy to another level by combining understanding with action. It involves not only recognizing and sharing the emotions of others but also taking practical steps to address and resolve their pain or challenges. In customer service, compassionate empathy is the pinnacle of empathetic behavior. Customer service representatives who can reach this level can effectively connect with customers, understand their needs and frustrations, and take prompt and proactive measures to resolve their issues swiftly.

- Understanding and developing these different types of empathy is crucial for customer service professionals. By practicing cognitive empathy, emotional empathy, and striving to achieve compassionate empathy, customer service representatives can provide a higher level of support and build stronger connections with customers, ultimately fostering positive experiences and customer loyalty.

### <ins>Importance of Empathy in Customer Interactions</ins>

- Building Lasting Relationships: Empathy is the foundation of building lasting relationships with customers. When customers feel understood and valued, they are more likely to develop trust and loyalty towards the brand.

- Enhancing Customer Retention: Empathetic interactions contribute to higher customer retention rates. Research shows that customers are willing to pay more for products or services from companies that prioritize their needs and demonstrate empathy in their interactions.

- Positive Word-of-Mouth: Empathetic customer service experiences are often shared through word-of-mouth and social media, contributing to positive brand reputation and attracting new customers.


### <ins>Techniques for Demonstrating Empathy</ins>

**Putting Oneself in the Customer's Shoes:**

 - Encourage employees to practice empathy by considering the customer's perspective, emotions, and circumstances.
 - For example, if a customer complains about a delayed delivery, employees can imagine how frustrating it would be to wait for an important package and empathize with the inconvenience caused.

**Active Listening:**

 - Active listening involves fully concentrating on what the customer is saying without interrupting or formulating responses prematurely.
 - Employees can demonstrate active listening by nodding, making eye contact, and providing verbal cues such as "I understand" or "That sounds challenging" to show they are engaged and empathetic.

**Offering Genuine Apologies When Necessary:**

 - Genuine apologies are an essential aspect of empathetic communication, acknowledging the customer's feelings and expressing regret for any inconvenience or dissatisfaction.
 - For example, if a customer receives a damaged product, employees can offer a sincere apology and assure the customer that steps will be taken to rectify the situation promptly.

### How to develop empathy in customer service

- After working in customer support for several years, I can attest that even the most empathetic of us get worn down. It’s hard to remember to show compassion when you deal with angry email after angry email. Especially when it’s unjustified and irrational. 
- But, that’s human nature. And, as customer support professionals, we chose this life. I developed a few tips to help me stay empathetic, even during the worst of times.

**Pause to stay mindful**

- Wading through a seemingly infinite queue of customer complaints wears down empathy. Stay refreshed by taking breaks. A quick stretch, snack, or context switch can help keep your mind fresh. 

- By thinking clearly, you can tap into the customer’s perspective and understand their story. Give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they’ve had a bad day and are taking it out on you. 

- When you approach issues objectively and mindfully, you can show more compassion and empathy to your customers. 

**Take action with active listening** 

- Dig deeper to find the cause behind the complaint. Ask questions and follow up to get to the root of the issue. By actively listening in customer service, you can avoid unnecessary back and forth and get to a resolution quicker. 
- Remember, more than anything, your customers contacted you to solve a problem. Tap into your product knowledge and offer thoughtful resolutions to their requests. 

**Bond with teammates**

- Empathy is a cyclical force. The more you feel heard and accepted, the easier it is to give that to others. Especially in the world of customer service where burnout is high, bonding with coworkers can make all the difference. 

- Allow yourself to vent when you need it. Share a funny customer story with a coworker. Take some of the emotional burden off yourself by sharing customer moments with others. Other departments may even offer new resolutions or incorporate customer feedback into upcoming features.

**Benefits of empathy training** 

- Of course, empathizing with others “feels” good. But in the world of business, we rely on numbers and data to back up those feelings. Thankfully, the Harvard Business Review did the work for us. 

- They explain the correlation between empathy and success, citing that 80% of departments with higher empathy skills also prove to be better performers. In addition, the top ten companies in the Global Empathy Index 2015 doubled their value and generated 50% more earnings (defined by market capitalization) than the bottom ten. 

- And—this is fascinating—they drew a correlation between empathy and ethics. Scandals at Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo caused a significant drop in their empathy ranking and brand reputation. Focusing on empathy building may help prevent ethical scandals and customer disdain. 

- As is true in most cases of innovation these days, tech companies lead the charge in empathy training. They made up about 60% of the top ten most empathetic companies in 2016. And tech companies like Facebook doubled down on the benefits of empathy with the introduction of their “Empathy Lab.”
